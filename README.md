# Nimbly Boilerplate

## Requirements
- PHP 7+ (for dev server, not needed in production)
- NodeJS 8+
- NPM

## Usage

0) Clone the repo: `git clone <this_repo_url>`  
1) Install dependencies: `npm install`  
2) Edit project details in package.json  
3) In one terminal, `cd` to the project root and run: `npm run watch`. This will continously build the application as soon as a file changes.  
4) In the second terminal, `cd` to the project root and run: `npm run serve`. This will boot up a PHP web server
